# Tricks Not Treats
This game was originally intended for the [Spooktober Visual Novel Jam](https://itch.io/jam/spooktober-vn-jam-2022) but due to personal issues I had to continue development beyond September and well into October.

## Game Engine
This game was developed on Godot Engine v3.5.1.stable.official [6fed1ffa3]. Usage of this engine introduced a substantial amount of difficulty when developing the VN especially in the face of the personal difficulties I faced but I found development using this to be truly enjoyable and a smooth process.
